This Python script translates text in a CSV file from Hindi to English using the Google Translate API. The script first reads a CSV file named hindi.csv into a Pandas DataFrame. It then initializes the Google Translator and creates a dictionary to store translations. For each unique value in each column of the DataFrame, it translates the text and updates the dictionary with the translated values. The script then replaces the original text with the translated text in the DataFrame and prints the updated DataFrame.
